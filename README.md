# tcp-learning-space
This is a TCP server that demonstrates how transport layer works using telnet protocol.

## Tech stack 
- node:net => This is core node module that provides an asynchronous network API for creating stream-based TCP or IPC servers and clients.
  
  > node documentation: https://nodejs.org/api/net.html

## Usage 
- To get started, you need to clone the git repository onto your local machine by using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/backendbro/tcp-learning-space`
> No external dependency was used for this project. However, you can install nodemon to watch your server.
- Open your terminal and run the application using `npm run start`

- To establish a TCP connection, open a command prompt and type: `telent 127.0.0.1 8080`

  > Where:
      **127.0.0.1** Is our local machine. While, **8080** Is the designated PORT
-  Enter a response and press the **ENTER** key to proceed
